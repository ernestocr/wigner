    "In the article they generalize the Wigner function a bit to other phase-space cuasi-distributions. Such maps can be refined by imposing additional structure other than the satisfaction of the Stratonovich-Weyl criteria, e.g., one possible condition could be the marginal reduction, i.e. that summing the image of the density matrix in the phase space along a set of points associated with a given state one obtains the probability distribution in this state. This requirement gives a clear geometric interpretation of the discrete map and is also known as a *tomographic condition*."

    "As we've mentioned, everything up till now has been in the context of the lines of the discrete phase space. First of all, we can obtain MUBs via the rotation operators as long as the rotation coefficients satisfy the recurrence relation. The author's state that there are multiple solutions. How different is there proposed solution with the Galois ring method of the coding theory authors? By defining the Wigner function using the displacement operators and imposing the tomographic condition one obtains the relation between the phase and the rotation coefficients seen before:\n",
