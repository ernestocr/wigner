  abstract = {In this paper we give explicit descriptions of complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and orthogonal decompositions of special Lie algebras sln(C) obtained from commutative and symplectic semifields, and from some other non-semifield symplectic spreads. Relations between various constructions are also studied. We show that the automorphism group of a complete set of MUBs is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the corresponding orthogonal decomposition of the Lie algebra sln(C). In the case of symplectic spreads this automorphism group is determined by the automorphism group of the spread. By using the new notion of pseudo-planar functions over fields of characteristic two we give new explicit constructions of complete sets of MUBs.},

More precisely, we show that a collection of µ MUBs in Kn gives rise to a collection of µ Cartan subalgebras of the special linear Lie algebra sln(K) that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form, where K = R or K = C. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in Cn gives rise to a so-called orthogonal decomposition (OD) of sln(C). The converse holds if the Cartan subalgebras in the OD are also †-closed, i.e., closed under the adjoint operation. In this case, the Cartan subalgebras have unitary bases, and the above correspondence becomes equivalent to a result of [3] relating collections of MUBs to collections of maximal commuting classes of unitary error bases, i.e., orthogonal unitary matrices.},

In the phase-space formulation, they have real, true unitary representations in the space of square-integrable functions on phase-space. Each such phase-space representation is a Weyl-Wigner product of the corresponding Hilbert space representation with its contragredient, and these can be recovered by ‘factorising’ the Weyl-Wigner product. However, not every real, unitary representation on phase-space corresponds to a group of automorphisms, so not every such representation is in the form of a Weyl-Wigner product and can be factorised.

Their respective eigenvalues are determined as functions of a, in terms of the Gauss-Laguerre polynomials. These polynomials provide a basis of vectors in a Hilbert space carrying the positive discrete series representation of the algebra su(1, 1) ≈ so(2, 1).

Quantum symmetries are described by complex, unitary or antiunitary operators defining ray representations in Hilbert space, whereas in phase space they are described by real, true representations. Equivalence of the formulations requires that the former representations can be obtained from the latter and vice versa. Examples are given. Equivalence of the two formulations also requires that complex superpositions of state vectors can be described in the phase space formulation, and it is shown that this leads to a nonlinear superposition principle for orthogonal, pure-state Wigner functions.

  abstract = {We set up Wigner distributions for N-state quantum systems following a Diracinspired approach. In contrast to much of the work in this study, requiring a 2N × 2N phase space, particularly when N is even, our approach is uniformly based on an N × N phase-space grid and thereby avoids the necessity of having to invoke a ‘quadrupled’ phase space and hence the attendant redundance. Both N odd and even cases are analysed in detail and it is found that there are striking differences between the two. While the N odd case permits full implementation of the marginal property, the even case does so only in a restricted sense. This has the consequence that in the even case one is led to several equally good definitions of the Wigner distributions as opposed to the odd case where the choice turns out to be unique.},

  abstract = {A set of d2 vectors in a Hilbert space of dimension d is called equiangular if each pair of vectors encloses the same angle. The projection operators onto these vectors define a POVM which is distinguished by its high degree of symmetry. Measures of this kind are called symmetric informationally complete, or SIC POVMs for short, and could be applied for quantum state tomography. Despite its simple geometrical description, the problem of constructing SIC POVMs or even proving their existence seems to be very hard. It is our purpose to introduce two applications of discrete Wigner functions to the analysis of the problem at hand. First, we will present a method for identifying symmetries of SIC POVMs under Clifford operations. This constitutes an alternative approach to a structure described before by Zauner and Appleby. Further, a simple and geometrically motivated construction for an SIC POVM in dimensions two and three is given (which, unfortunately, allows no generalization). Even though no new structures are found, we hope that the re-formulation of the problem may prove useful for future inquiries.},

In this case, the CPS can possess a strong coordinate (or momentum) squeezing, which is roughly twice weaker than for the vacuum squeezed states. The Robertson–Schrödinger invariant uncertainty product in the CPS logarithmically increases with the mean value of the number operator (whereas it is constant for the standard coherent states).

  abstract = {Mutually unbiased bases generalize the X, Y and Z qubit bases. They possess numerous applications in quantum information science. It is well known that in prime power dimensions N = pm (with p prime and m a positive integer), there exists a maximal set of N + 1 mutually unbiased bases. In the present paper, we derive an explicit expression for those bases, in terms of the (operations of the) associated finite field (Galois division ring) of N elements. This expression is shown to be equivalent to the expressions previously obtained by Ivanovic (1981 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 14 3241) in odd prime dimensions, and Wootters and Fields (1989 Ann. Phys. 191 363) in odd prime power dimensions. In even prime power dimensions, we derive a new explicit expression for the mutually unbiased bases. The new ingredients of our approach are, basically, the following: we provide a simple expression of the generalized Pauli group in terms of the additive characters of the field, and we derive an exact groupal composition law between the elements of the commuting subsets of the generalized Pauli group, renormalized by a wellchosen phase-factor.},

Our first criterion is the minimisation of the redundancy of the data acquired during the tomographic process. In the case of two-qubits tomography, we also analyze this process from the point of view of factorisability, so to say we analyze the possibility to realise the tomographic process through local operations and classical communications between local observers. Finally, we present new results that concern the extension of the one- and twoqubit cases to higher dimensions.},

  abstract = {Mutually unbiased bases for quantum degrees of freedom are central to all theoretical investigations and practical exploitations of complementary properties. Much is known about mutually unbiased bases, but there are also a fair number of important questions that have not been answered in full as yet. In particular, one can find maximal sets of \$\{N+1\}\$ mutually unbiased bases in Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimension \$\{N=p\^\textbackslash m\}\$, with \$p\$ prime and \$\textbackslash m\$ a positive integer, and there is a continuum of mutually unbiased bases for a continuous degree of freedom, such as motion along a line. But not a single example of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number (\$N=6,10,12,...\$). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the basis states are labeled by numbers \$\{0,1,2,...,N-1\}\$ that are both elements of a Galois field and ordinary integers. This dual nature permits a compact systematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they are known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other cases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually unbiased bases in quantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation, entanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which rely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the familiar two--q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased bases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also exploit the one-to-one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex Hadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other. The ultimate hope, not yet fulfilled, is that open questions about mutually unbiased bases can be related to open questions about Hadamard matrices or affine planes, in particular the ...[rest deleted]},

The latter are realized by means of unitary operators in Fock space extended by 2D vector spaces, physically identified with finite-dimensional systems.

A remarkable property is that Weyl ordering of operators is covariant under similarity transformation, so it has many applications in quantum statistics and signal analysis. Thus the invention of the IWWOP technique promotes the progress of Dirac’s symbolic method.},

In this comparison we focus on the differences in initial conditions available to each theory as well as the differences in dynamics. First we derive new necessary conditions for the admissibility of Wigner functions and interpret their physical meaning. One advantage of these conditions is that they have a natural, geometric interpretation as integrals over polygons in phase space. Furthermore, they hint at what is required beyond the uncertainty principle in order for a Wigner function to be valid. Next we design and implement numerical methods to propagate Wigner functions via the quantum Liouville equation. Using these methods we study the quantum mechanical phenomena of reflection, interference, and tunnelling and explain how these phenomena arise in phase space as a direct consequence of the first quantum correction to classical mechanics.},

Wigner functions have also been developed for discrete quantum systems, one popular version being defined on a 2N × 2N discrete phase space for a system with N orthogonal states. Here we investigate an alternative class of discrete Wigner functions, in which the field of real numbers that labels the axes of continuous phase space is replaced by a finite field having N elements. There exists such a field if and only if N is a power of a prime; so our formulation can be applied directly only to systems for which the state-space dimension takes such a value. Though this condition may seem limiting, we note that any quantum computer based on qubits meets the condition and can thus be accommodated within our scheme. The geometry of our N × N phase space also leads naturally to a method of constructing a complete set of N + 1 mutually unbiased bases for the state space.},

Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers — the difficulty of describing them on classical computers —also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

The Clifford group is identified as the set of unitary operations which preserve positivity. The result can be seen as a discrete version of Hudson's Theorem. Hudson established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure state has no negative values if and only if the state is Gaussian. Turning to mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this conjecture by means of a counter-example. Further, we give an axiomatic characterization which completely fixes the definition of the Wigner function and compare two approaches to stabilizer states for Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimensions. In the course of the discussion, we derive explicit formulas for the number of stabilizer codes defined on such systems.},

One seminal notion of classicality of a quantum system is the existence of a non-contextual hidden variable model as introduced in the early work by Bell, Kochen and Specker. In quantum optics, the non-negativity of the Wigner function is a ubiquitous notion of classicality. In this work we establish an equivalence between these two concepts. In particular, we show that any non-contextual hidden variable model for Gaussian quantum optics has an alternative non-negative Wigner function description. Conversely, it was known that the Wigner representation provides a non-negative non-contextual description of Gaussian quantum optics. It follows that contextuality and Wigner negativity are equivalent notions of non-classicality and equivalent resources for this quantum subtheory. In particular, both contextuality and Wigner negativity are necessary for a computational speed-up of quantum Gaussian optics. At the technical level, our result holds true for any subfamily of Gaussian measurements that include homodyne measurements, i.e., measurements of standard quadrature observables.},

  abstract = {Certain notorious nonlinear binary codes contain more codewords than any known linear code. These include the codes constructed by Nordstrom-Robinson, Kerdock, Preparata, Goethals, and Delsarte-Goethals. It is shown here that all these codes can be very simply constructed as binary images under the Gray map of linear codes over Za, the integers mod 4 (although this requires a slight modification of the Preparata and Goethals codes). The construction implies that all these binary codes are distance invariant. Duality in the Z4 domain implies that the binary images have dual weight distributions. The Kerdock and “Preparata” codes are duals over Z4-and the Nordstrom-Robinson code is self-dual-which explains why their weight distributions are dual to each other. The Kerdock and “Preparata” codes are Z* -analogues of first-order Reed-Muller and extended Hamming codes, respectively. All these codes are extended cyclic codes over Z4, which greatly simplies encoding and decoding. An algebraic hard-decision decoding algorithm is given for the “Preparata” code and a Hadamard-transform softdecision decoding algorithm for the Kerdock code. Binary firstand second-order Reed-Muller codes are also linear over \&, but extended Hamming codes of length n {$>\_$} 32 and the Golay code are not. Using Z.\$-linearity, a new family of distance regular graphs are constructed on the cosets of the “Preparata” code.},

  abstract = {In the Wigner-Moyal approach to quantum mechanics, we show that Moyal’s starting point, the characteristic function M (τ, θ) = ψ∗(x)ei(τpˆ+θxˆ)ψ(x)dx, is essentially the primitive idempotent used by von Neumann in his classic paper “Die Eindeutigkeit der Schr¨odingerschen Operatoren”. This paper provides the original proof of the Stone-von Neumann equation. Thus the mathematical structure Moyal develops is simply a re-expression of what is at the heart of quantum mechanics. This means it exactly reproduces the results of the quantum formalism. The “distribution function” F (X, P, t) is not a probability distribution. It is a quantum mechanical density matrix expressed in an (X, P )-representation, where X and P are the mean co-ordinates of a cell structure in phase space. The whole approach therefore clearly has little to do with classical statistical theories.},

Furthermore we argue that these two approaches can be seen as different but related aspects of standard quantum formalism when the algebraic approach, rather than the Hilbert space approach is taken as primary. This leads us to consider the non-commutative Moyal *algebra in which two key equations obtained are shown to be the analogue of algebraic equations derived by Brown and Hiley using the algebraic approach. The different phase spaces exploited in each case appear as necessary consequences of the non-commutative algebra since they are but shadow manifolds already implicit in the algebra defining the quantum formalism.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the answer to the most basic question "What is the source of the power in quantum computing?" has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via magic state distillation. This is a conceptually satisfying link because contextuality provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena and, moreover, magic state distillation is the leading model for experimentally realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the nonlocality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality and nonlocality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation and bounding the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {Starting from the famous Pauli problem on the possibility to associate quantum states with probabilities, the formulation of quantum mechanics in which quantum states are described by fair probability distributions (tomograms, i.e. tomographic probabilities) is reviewed in a pedagogical style. The relation between the quantum state description and the classical state description is elucidated. The difference of those sets of tomograms is described by inequalities equivalent to a complete set of uncertainty relations for the quantum domain and to nonnegativity of probability density on phase space in the classical domain. Intersection of such sets is studied. The mathematical mechanism which allows to construct different kinds of tomographic probabilities like symplectic tomograms, spin tomograms, photon number tomograms, etc., is clarified and a connection with abstract Hilbert space properties is established. Superposition rule and uncertainty relations in terms of probabilities as well as quantum basic equation like quantum evolution and energy spectra equations are given in explicit form. A method to check experimentally uncertainty relations is suggested using optical tomograms. Entanglement phenomena and the connection with semigroups acting on simplexes are studied in detail for spin states in the case of two qubits. The star-product formalism is associated with the tomographic probability formulation of quantum mechanics.},

An open problem posed by Schlingemann and Werner relates these two constructions and asks whether each nice error basis is equivalent to a shift-and-multiply basis. We solve this problem and show that the answer is negative. However, we find that nice error bases have more structure than one can anticipate from their definition. In particular, we show that nice error bases can be written in a form in which at least half of the matrix entries are 0.},

  abstract = {The principle of complementarity lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. In finite dimensional quantum systems this principle is captured by pairs of observables which are given by mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Two orthonormal bases B and C of Cd are mutually unbiased if | b|c |2 = 1/d holds for all vectors b ∈ B and c ∈ C. This implies that whenever we are given a vector from one of these bases and perform a measurement with respect to any other of the bases, then there is no information gained from this measurement. A basic question about MUBs is how many of them can be found in a given dimension d. While constructions of maximal sets of d + 1 such bases are known for system of prime power dimension d, it is unknown whether this bound can be achieved for any non-prime power dimension. We review the known constructions of MUBs and demonstrate that maximal sets of MUBs come with a rich combinatorial structure by showing that they actually are the same objects as the complex projective 2-designs with angle set \{0, 1/d\}. Furthermore, we address the problem of constructing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) in finite dimension d consisting of d2 operators of rank one which have an inner product equal to uniform or very close to uniform. This is motivated by the related question of constructing symmetric informationally complete POVMs (SIC-POVMs) for which the inner products are perfectly uniform. We also give a simple proof of the fact that symmetric informationally complete POVMs are complex projective 2-designs with angle set \{1/(d+1)\}. Moreover, we show that MUBs and SIC-POVMs form uniform tight frames in Cd.},

This allows us to consider semiclassical evolution of discrete systems in terms of an expansion of the propagator in powers of ℏ. The largest power of ℏ required to describe the evolution is a traditional measure of classicality. We show that the action of the Clifford operators on stabilizer states can be fully described by a single contribution of a path integral truncated at order ℏ0 and so are "classical," just like propagation of Gaussians under harmonic Hamiltonians in the continuous case. Such operations have no dependence on phase or quantum interference. Conversely, we show that supplementing the Clifford group with gates necessary for universal quantum computation results in a propagator consisting of a finite number of semiclassical path integral contributions truncated at order ℏ1 , a number that nevertheless scales exponentially with the number of qudits. The same sum in continuous systems has an infinite number of terms at order ℏ1.},

We present an alternative proof of this result for quopit Clifford circuits (i.e., Clifford circuits on collections of p-level systems, where p is an odd prime) using Feynman’s sum-over-paths technique, which allows the amplitudes of arbitrary quantum circuits to be expressed in terms of a weighted sum over computational paths. For a general quantum circuit, the sum over paths contains an exponential number of terms, and no efficient classical algorithm is known that can compute the sum. For quopit Clifford circuits, however, we show that the sum over paths takes a special form: it can be expressed as a product of Weil sums with quadratic polynomials, which can be computed efficiently. This provides a method for computing the outcome probabilities and amplitudes of such circuits efficiently, and is an application of the circuit-polynomial correspondence which relates quantum circuits to low-degree polynomials.},

  abstract = {Teichmüller set. Each primitive polynomial in Fp[X] characterizes a set of basic primitive polynomials in Zps [X], namely its inverse image under the projection πp. The p-adic representation depends on the chosen basic primitive polynomial. We have developed a series of programs, basically in sage, to find monic basic primitive polynomials and convert additive representations into p-adic representations of the Galois ring elements, and conversely. For any m ∈ Z+ there is [2] a monic primitive polynomial fpm(X) ∈ Fp[X] dividing Ppm(X) = Xpm−1 − 1 in Fp[X]. Then, by Hensel Lift [3] there is a monic basic primitive polynomial fpsm(X) ∈ Zps [X] dividing Ppm(X) in Zps [X] with projection fpm(X). Since fpm(X) ∈ Fp[X] is irreducible with no multiple roots, the polynomial fpsm(X) ∈ Zps [X] is unique [4]. Hence, a natural correspondence fpm(X) ↔ fpsm(X) arises, and in most cases it is not the identity, namely fpm(X) = fpsm(X) in Zps [X]. In the worst case, for small values of m and s the search of the Hensel lift polynomial fpsm(X) ∈ Zps [X] can be done exhaustively. Alternatively, a list [2] of monic primitive polynomials in the ring Fp[X] may be provided in order to consider the inverse images of those polynomials under the projection modulus p. The interest in finding effective and efficient representation conversions is due to the implementation of authentication codes based on the Gray transform [1].},

Along our way, we provide a theoretical proof of the invalidity of Flandrin’s conjecture, a fact already proven via numerical arguments in our joint paper [4] with B. Delourme and T. Duyckaerts. We use also the J.G. Wood \& A.J. Bracken paper [48], for which we offer a mathematical perspective. We review thoroughly the case of subsets of the plane whose boundary is a conic curve and show that Mehler’s formula can be helpful in the analysis of these cases, including for the higher dimensional case investigated in the paper [33] by E. Lieb and Y. Ostrover. Using the Feichtinger algebra, we show that, generically in the Baire sense, the Wigner distribution of a pulse in L2(Rn) does not belong to L1(R2n), providing as a byproduct a large class of examples of subsets of the phase space R2n on which the integral of the Wigner distribution is infinite. We study as well the case of convex polygons of the plane, with a rather weak estimate depending on the number of vertices, but independent of the area of the polygon.},

  abstract = {An attempt is made to interpret quantum mechanics as a statistical theory, or more exactly as a form of non-deterministic statistical dynamics. The paper falls into three parts. In the first, the distribution functions of the complete set of dynamical variables specifying a mechanical system (phase-space distributions), which are fundamental in any form of statistical dynamics, are expressed in terms of the wave vectors of quantum theory. This is shown to be equivalent to specifying a theory of functions of non-commuting operators, and may hence be considered as an interpretation of               quantum kinematics               . In the second part, the laws governing the transformation with time of these phase-space distributions are derived from the equations of motion of               quantum dynamics               and found to be of the required form for a dynamical stochastic process. It is shown that these phase-space transformation equations can be used as an alternative to the Schrödinger equation in the solution of quantum mechanical problems, such as the evolution with time of wave packets, collision problems and the calculation of transition probabilities in perturbed systems; an approximation method is derived for this purpose. The third part,               quantum statistics               , deals with the phase-space distribution of members of large assemblies, with a view to applications of quantum mechanics to kinetic theories of matter. Finally, the limitations of the theory, its uniqueness and the possibilities of experimental verification are discussed.},

We show that, for a system of qubits, finding such a generator can be cast as the problem of finding a symmetric matrix over the field 2 equipped with an irreducible characteristic polynomial of a given Fibonacci index. The entanglement structure of the resulting complete sets is determined by two additive matrices of the same size.},

  abstract = {Quantum systems where the position and momentum are in the ring Zd (d is an odd integer) are considered. A tomographically complete set of bases, i.e. a set of bases such that probabilities from tomography experiments corresponding to these bases, can be used for the calculation of an arbitrary density matrix, is considered. Such a set of bases is constructed by considering a factorization of a system with dimension d = p1 p2 (where p1, p2 are prime numbers) in terms of two subsystems with dimensions p1 and p2. Appropriate combination of the mutually unbiased bases in the subsystems, leads to a tomographically complete set of bases in the full system. This set leads to probabilities along all the lines through the origin (0, 0) in the Zd × Zd phase space, with exactly d points. It is shown that the number of these lines is ψ (d) (the Dedekind function). The general theory is exemplified with examples.},

Every element of GR(pr, m) can be expressed uniquely as a polynomial in ω with coefficients in Zpr and degree less than or equal to m − 1, thus GR(pr, m) is a free module of rank m over Zpr with basis \{1, ω, ω2, . . . , ωm−1\}.

  abstract = {We present an algebraic approach to the quantum net construction developed by Wootters and coworkers in the context of finite field based phase space formulation of quantum systems described by a complex Hilbert space of prime power dimensions. Our method of construction of quantum nets is based on what we call a Dirac inspired square root approach to Wigner distributions which has been shown in our earlier works, not only reproduces the original Wigner construction for quantum systems with Cartesian degrees of freedom but also proves to be extremely useful in providing a finite ring based phase space description for quantum systems of arbitrary but finite (complex Hilbert space) dimensions. We suggest that in even prime dimensions our method leads to the same family of Wigner distributions as given by the quantum net construction of Wootters et al. On the other hand, in odd prime power dimensions, we find that this is not so. Among various possibilities afforded by their approach our method yields only the Clifford covariant or the most symmetric choice.},
